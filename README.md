# Water Meter Digitization

This project demonstrates a Python script using OpenCV and Tesseract to extract text from water meter images and print it directly to the console. It showcases a potential approach for streamlining water meter reading processes in Rwanda by digitizing traditional meters with computer vision techniques.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Python code for image processing and OCR
    - **image_utils.py**: Utility functions for image preprocessing (grayscale conversion, noise reduction, etc.).
    - **meter_detector.py**: Algorithm to detect and isolate water meter regions in images.
    - **ocr_engine.py**: Tesseract-based OCR engine for text extraction from detected regions.
    - **main.py**: Main script that orchestrates the image processing and OCR workflow.
    - **requirements.txt**: List of required Python dependencies (e.g., OpenCV, Tesseract, NumPy).

## Getting Started

1. **Install requirements**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Ensure Tesseract is installed**: Refer to official documentation for setup: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
3. **Place input image**: Put your water meter image in the same directory as `main.py`.

## Running the Script

```bash
python src/main.py "image.jpg"


Replace `"image.jpg"` with the actual filename of your image.

## Example Output

The script will extract the text from the water meter region in the image and print it directly to the console. For example:


Extracted text: 12345678
